Invenio module for collecting statistics.

This module provides the components for **statistical data processing and
querying**.

The most common statistics measure the occurence of events in an invenio
application, e.g. file downloads, record views and others. Invenio-stats
provides the tools to transform, register, compress and query those events.
However, statistics can be fully customized and directly query the database.

The services it uses are:

- RabbitMQ for buffering incoming events.
- Elasticsearch for aggregating and searching events.

Further documentation is available on: https://invenio-stats.readthedocs.io/
